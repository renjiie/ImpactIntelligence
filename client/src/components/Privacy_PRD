PRD: Privacy Compliance and Management in AdTech

1. Overview

With evolving privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) and the deprecation of third-party cookies and device IDs, this project aims to establish a robust privacy layer in the AdTech stack to ensure compliance and maintain advertiser effectiveness.

⸻

2. Objectives
	•	Ensure full compliance with global data privacy regulations.
	•	Minimize data leakage and unauthorized user tracking.
	•	Maintain ad delivery performance using privacy-preserving alternatives.
	•	Enable easy audit, consent management, and data subject request (DSR) handling.

⸻

3. Key Features

🔐 Consent Management Platform (CMP) Integration
	•	Integrate IAB TCF 2.2-compliant CMP for web and mobile.
	•	Capture, store, and respect user preferences per jurisdiction.
	•	Sync consent signals across all platforms (web, app, connected TV).

🧠 Contextual Targeting Module
	•	Replace user-level behavioral targeting with page-level/contextual signals.
	•	NLP-based content categorization for privacy-safe relevance.
	•	Use real-time bidding (RTB) signals without user IDs.

🔄 First-Party Data Framework
	•	Enable secure ingestion of publisher/advertiser first-party data.
	•	Support hashed emails, consent-based CRM onboarding.
	•	Secure identity resolution using privacy-compliant clean rooms (e.g., AWS Clean Rooms, InfoSum).

📉 Anonymous Attribution & Reporting
	•	Implement multi-touch attribution without PII (e.g., differential privacy techniques).
	•	Use SKAdNetwork (iOS) or Android Privacy Sandbox for app campaign measurement.
	•	Aggregate event-level reporting for campaigns.

🔍 Data Access & Deletion Interface
	•	UI/API for Data Subject Requests (DSR): Access, Delete, Correct.
	•	Logs all DSR activities with timestamps.
	•	Integrate with internal data lake to find all instances of user data.

⸻
4. Engineering Considerations
	•	Tech Stack: JavaScript SDKs for CMPs, server-side Go/Node.js services for consent sync, AWS S3/Lambda for DSR processing.
	•	Storage: Use encrypted, region-compliant data stores with TTL for sensitive user identifiers.
	•	APIs: Standardized Consent APIs (IAB, OneTrust) + internal audit logging microservices.
	•	Security: Implement role-based access, hashing for identifiers, and endpoint monitoring.

🔐 High-Level Tasks for Implementing a Privacy Use Case in AdTech

⸻
📌 Use Case:

“Implement contextual ad targeting using real-time in-session signals without violating user privacy laws.”

⸻

🧠 1. Requirements & Legal Alignment
	•	Identify and document the behavioral signals needed (e.g. scroll depth, dwell time, hover events).
	•	Collaborate with the Legal/Privacy team to define:
	•	Consent requirements under GDPR/CCPA.
	•	Data classification (e.g., is session data personal data?).
	•	Retention policy for transient signals.
	•	Update the Consent Management Platform (CMP) to include new signal tracking permissions.
	•	Define fallback behaviors when consent is not granted.

⸻

🛠️ 2. Frontend Signal Capture
	•	Design and implement a lightweight JS module to collect session signals.
	•	Ensure signals are anonymized or obfuscated before transmission.
	•	Batch and throttle signal capture to avoid user performance impact.
	•	Add runtime checks to honor user consent in real time.

⸻

🧱 3. Backend Ingestion Pipeline
	•	Create or extend an event ingestion pipeline (e.g., Kafka, Kinesis) for session_behavior_signals.
	•	Add schema validation and enforcement for incoming event data.
	•	Build data filtering and tagging modules to route only clean, privacy-compliant signals downstream.
	•	Implement logging, monitoring, and redaction for sensitive anomalies.

⸻

🧮 4. Data Usage and Modeling
	•	Create rules for how session data can influence ad targeting (e.g., in-flight enrichment without persistence).
	•	Integrate with the real-time ad request pipeline for contextual enrichment.
	•	Ensure any derived models are retrained with privacy-aware datasets.
	•	Add data lineage tracking to know where signal data flows and is stored.

⸻

🧪 5. QA, Auditing, and Testing
	•	Run end-to-end tests simulating with and without user consent.
	•	Conduct a privacy impact assessment (PIA).
	•	Perform load testing with real-time data flow under peak conditions.
	•	Set up automated alerts for anomalies, signal spikes, or schema breaks.

⸻

🌍 6. Cross-Team and Deployment Activities
	•	Coordinate deployment timeline across Legal, Data, Infra, Ad Engineering, and Product.
	•	Train internal stakeholders on the feature and its privacy implications.
	•	Roll out feature behind a feature flag, default OFF.
	•	Create a rollback strategy in case of compliance violations or system degradation.

⸻

📜 7. Documentation and Transparency
	•	Update internal privacy documentation.
	•	Create external-facing explanations for users on how session behavior is used.
	•	Maintain version-controlled changelogs and audit trails.
