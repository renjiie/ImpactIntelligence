PRD: Privacy Compliance and Management in AdTech

1. Overview

With evolving privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) and the deprecation of third-party cookies and device IDs, this project aims to establish a robust privacy layer in the AdTech stack to ensure compliance and maintain advertiser effectiveness.

⸻

2. Objectives
	•	Ensure full compliance with global data privacy regulations.
	•	Minimize data leakage and unauthorized user tracking.
	•	Maintain ad delivery performance using privacy-preserving alternatives.
	•	Enable easy audit, consent management, and data subject request (DSR) handling.

⸻

3. Key Features

🔐 Consent Management Platform (CMP) Integration
	•	Integrate IAB TCF 2.2-compliant CMP for web and mobile.
	•	Capture, store, and respect user preferences per jurisdiction.
	•	Sync consent signals across all platforms (web, app, connected TV).

🧠 Contextual Targeting Module
	•	Replace user-level behavioral targeting with page-level/contextual signals.
	•	NLP-based content categorization for privacy-safe relevance.
	•	Use real-time bidding (RTB) signals without user IDs.

🔄 First-Party Data Framework
	•	Enable secure ingestion of publisher/advertiser first-party data.
	•	Support hashed emails, consent-based CRM onboarding.
	•	Secure identity resolution using privacy-compliant clean rooms (e.g., AWS Clean Rooms, InfoSum).

📉 Anonymous Attribution & Reporting
	•	Implement multi-touch attribution without PII (e.g., differential privacy techniques).
	•	Use SKAdNetwork (iOS) or Android Privacy Sandbox for app campaign measurement.
	•	Aggregate event-level reporting for campaigns.

🔍 Data Access & Deletion Interface
	•	UI/API for Data Subject Requests (DSR): Access, Delete, Correct.
	•	Logs all DSR activities with timestamps.
	•	Integrate with internal data lake to find all instances of user data.

⸻
4. Engineering Considerations
	•	Tech Stack: JavaScript SDKs for CMPs, server-side Go/Node.js services for consent sync, AWS S3/Lambda for DSR processing.
	•	Storage: Use encrypted, region-compliant data stores with TTL for sensitive user identifiers.
	•	APIs: Standardized Consent APIs (IAB, OneTrust) + internal audit logging microservices.
	•	Security: Implement role-based access, hashing for identifiers, and endpoint monitoring.
