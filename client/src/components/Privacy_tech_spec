üõ†Ô∏è Tech Spec: Privacy Compliance in AdTech

üìå Objective

To design and implement a privacy-first AdTech infrastructure that:
	‚Ä¢	Adheres to regulations (GDPR, CCPA, DPDP).
	‚Ä¢	Supports contextual targeting.
	‚Ä¢	Enables consent-based data flows and DSR compliance.

üß± System Components

1. Consent Management Platform (CMP) SDK
	‚Ä¢	Type: Web + Mobile SDK
	‚Ä¢	Responsibilities:
	‚Ä¢	Capture, store, and sync user consent.
	‚Ä¢	Provide UI for accept/reject granular permissions.
	‚Ä¢	Storage:
	‚Ä¢	Consent data stored in hashed format.
	‚Ä¢	Synced with backend using secure HTTPS endpoints.

‚∏ª

2. Identity Management Layer
	‚Ä¢	Type: Backend microservice
	‚Ä¢	Responsibilities:
	‚Ä¢	Support cookie-less identifiers (e.g., UUIDv4, Shared ID).
	‚Ä¢	Link consent token with identity.
	‚Ä¢	Privacy Feature:
	‚Ä¢	Expiration and renewal mechanism.
	‚Ä¢	No persistent ID without explicit consent.

‚∏ª

3. Contextual Targeting Engine
	‚Ä¢	Type: Service running in Ad Server
	‚Ä¢	Responsibilities:
	‚Ä¢	Analyze content of the page (keywords, tags).
	‚Ä¢	Match ads using context instead of behavioral data.
	‚Ä¢	Privacy:
	‚Ä¢	No cross-site user tracking.
	‚Ä¢	Works without third-party cookies.

‚∏ª

4. DSR Handling Service (Data Subject Requests)
	‚Ä¢	Type: API Layer + Worker
	‚Ä¢	Responsibilities:
	‚Ä¢	Accept requests: access, delete, portability.
	‚Ä¢	Queue and process deletions across systems.
	‚Ä¢	Security:
	‚Ä¢	Auth via secure token + request validation.
	‚Ä¢	Logging with audit trail.

‚∏ª

5. Privacy Analytics Layer
	‚Ä¢	Type: Internal analytics pipeline
	‚Ä¢	Responsibilities:
	‚Ä¢	Aggregate opt-in/out ratios, regional trends.
	‚Ä¢	No individual user PII exposure.
	‚Ä¢	Compliance:
	‚Ä¢	Use k-anonymity/differential privacy where needed.
	‚Ä¢	Role-based access control to dashboards.
